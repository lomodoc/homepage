# Installation Overview

To use Lomorage, you need to run the "Lomorage Photo Assistant" in your local network, either on Windows, OSX, Ubuntu, Raspbian, Armbian, using x86 or arm architecture. And then you need to download the client APP at the APP store. Once you run "Lomorage Photo Assistant", the client APP is supposed to find it automatically with zero configuration, then you can upload photos on the Phone.
