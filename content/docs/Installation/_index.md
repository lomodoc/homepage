# Installation Overview

To use Lomorage, you need to run the Lomorage service in your local network, either on Windows, OSX, Ubuntu, Raspbian, Armbian, using x86 or arm architecture. And then you need to download the client APP at the APP store. Once you run the Lomorage service, the client APP is supposed to find the service running automatically with zero configuration, then you can upload photos on the Phone.
