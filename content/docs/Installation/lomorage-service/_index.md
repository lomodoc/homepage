# Lomorage Service

The first step is to set up the Lomorage service.

**You can choose which version of Lomorage Service to download based on your preference**. Running Lomorage service on Windows or OSX gives you better performance compared with on SBC(Single Board Computer), the uploading and accessing the backup will be faster, but running on SBC like Raspberry Pi is more energy efficient. If using Raspberry Pi, you don't need to worry about the electricity bill, it is only [about 5$ a year](https://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/5033/how-much-energy-does-the-raspberry-pi-consume-in-a-day)
